This is an online store of 'frog juice'. This mystical panacea, collected from the most exotic and prestine sites around the world, is a complete figment of my imagination. I used it as the concept behind my very first HTML page years ago.  Now the concept returns, and this time as an online store!  

Below I will maintain a 'Features and Techs' that lists the features the store employs.
To view the store:

1. open the 'frog_juice' folder in your preferred IDE
2. open the IDE terminal
3. run 'npm install'
4. run 'npm start'
5. open 'localhost:3000' in your preferred web browser
      
      *** if you want to use a different port, 
      simply open the 'app.js' file and replace 
      3000 in 'app.listen(3000)' with the 
      port you would like to use ***

Enjoy!


*** Practically no frogs were harmed during the production of this site ***
